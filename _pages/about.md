I am a graduate student pursuing a Masters in Operations Research, with interest in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.

I have a strong working knowledge of deep learning, machine learning, and statistics and hands-on experience with statistical software and database languages.

I am comfortable working in a fast-paced, highly collaborative and dynamic work environment.I have the ability to think creatively to solve problems and can self-direct and self-motivate to achieve the required results.
